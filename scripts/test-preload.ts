// macOS `os.tmpdir()` resolves through the `/var -> /private/var` symlink, and the
// native owner-only primitive plus the session-storage reparse guard intentionally
// reject any symlinked path component. Production session roots live under a real
// home (`~/.gjc`) and never hit this, but tests create sessions under
// `mkdtemp(os.tmpdir())`, so every such path would trip the strict guards.
//
// Canonicalize the temp root once per test process so `os.tmpdir()` (and every
// `mkdtemp` derived from it) yields a symlink-free path that matches production.
// This is a no-op where `TMPDIR` is already canonical (e.g. Linux CI `/tmp`).
